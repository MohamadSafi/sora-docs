# Vesting in Cryptocurrency

Vesting is a method used in cryptocurrency projects to gradually release tokens over a specific period rather than distributing them all at once. Vesting is commonly applied to tokens allocated to project teams, early investors, and contributors, with the goal of encouraging long-term commitment and reducing the risk of sudden large sell-offs that could destabilize the token’s value.

Below this section, you’ll see the _Network Fee_, which varies based on the total amount of tokens to be vested.

Once you’re ready, click _Send_. You’ll be directed to a confirmation page to review the vesting transaction details.
