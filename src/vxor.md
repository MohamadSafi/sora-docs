# VXOR Token Overview

VXOR, or SORA Vested XOR, is a new token designed to foster productive economic growth within the SORA ecosystem. VXOR encourages long-term commitment from users by offering benefits tied to the vesting of XOR. This unique token aligns with SORA's goal of building a stable and incentivized community of builders and participants, including national entities.

# Key Features:

- Vesting Mechanism with Buy-Back-and-Burn: The VXOR mechanism uses 99% of the daily remint of XOR to buy back and burn VXOR, reducing supply and increasing value for vested participants. This mechanism essentially acts as a vesting tool to reward long-term holders.
- Encouraging Economic Expansion: Weekly calculations of the general price trend for XOR influence VXOR rewards. A positive trend results in additional VXOR being given to VXOR stakers and XOR-VXOR LP (Liquidity Provider) farmers. This mechanism is designed to align rewards with the growth in XOR’s market performance, encouraging builders and XOR-using countries to support SORA’s token economy actively.
- Support for SORAized Countries: Beyond individual builders, SORAized countries—nations that integrate XOR into their economies—can also receive VXOR through on-chain governance to bolster their economic expansion. The aim is to apply economic principles (ΔMV = ΔPY) to support increased purchasing power and economic growth in XOR-using regions.
- Sustainable XOR Supply Reduction: VXOR’s integration into SORA’s “v3 tokenomics” continues the gradual reduction in XOR supply, promoting a stable and long-term growth strategy for the SORA ecosystem.

# In Summary

VXOR is a vested token with a buy-back-and-burn mechanism designed to support SORA’s economic vision. It offers an innovative way for both individual participants and XOR-integrated nations to contribute to, and benefit from, the growth of the SORA ecosystem.
